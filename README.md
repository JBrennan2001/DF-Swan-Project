# DF Swan Project
In this group project we used logistic regression modelling to predict the probability of whether a customer is going to churn given features in a dataset.

## Project Description
We were given a dataset containing customer data from a client called Swan Teleco. We were tasked with exploring the data and looking for features that may be affecting whether or not a customer chooses to cancel their Swan Teleco subscription. After doing this we created an information deck (<i>Swan Project Information Deck.pptx</i>) to show the factors that seemed to be affecting customer churn rate the most and give possible retention strategies using this information. 
\
\
Our other task was to predict the churn risk for all customers who had not already churned. To do this we used Python libraries including Pandas and Sklearn and created a logistic regression model to use for our predictions. Using this model we produced a table containing the top 500 customers most likely to churn (<i>top_500_churn_risk.csv</i>) as well as another table containing the rest of the customer churn predictions (<i>churn_risk.csv</i>).
